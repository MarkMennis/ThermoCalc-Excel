# ThermoCalc-Excel

**ThermoCalc-Excel** is an attempt to streamline and automate ThermoCalc Macro creation by utilizing Excel's Interface as a Graphical Interface for ThermoCalc. This can be especially helpful when working with older TC versions that do not yet have a fully integrated Graphical Mode.

### The current project aims to provide:
1. A Customizable User Interface
1. Excel-enabled Tools for custom TC-Macro Automations
1. A VBA Toolbox for Completle integrating ThermoCalc & Excel
